# Stack and Queue Implementation
This is an implementation of the stack and queue which lets you pop, push, peek, enqueue, and dequeue

## Space/Time Complexity
### Peek
Time: O(1)
Space: O(1)

Shows you the element that will be returned, you don't iterate through and just peek at the first element so time and space are O(1).
### Push
Time: O(1)
Space: O(1)

Adds an element on top of the stack. Same as above, O(1).

### Pop
Time: O(1)
Space: O(1)

Returns the first element of a stack. Same as above so O(1)

### Enqueue
Time: O(1)
Space: O(1)

Adds an element to the back of the queue. Same as above, O(1).
### Dequeue
Time: O(1)
Space: O(1)

Reutrns the element at the end of the queue. Same as above, O(1).
