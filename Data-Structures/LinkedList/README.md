# Linked-List Implementation
This is an implementation of a linked-list with the methods: add, print, append, addbefore and addafter.

## Space/Time Complexity
### Add
Time: O(1)
Space: O(1)

Adds to the beginning of the list and does not need to create a new linked-list

### Print
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)

Prints every element, does not create a new list, time of n because you have to traverse the whole list
### Append
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)

Does not create a new list, time of n because it appends at the end of the list which means you have to traverse the whole list
### AddBefore
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)

Does not create a new list, time of n because you might have to traverse the whole list to find the value
### AddAfter
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)

Does not create a new list, time of n because you might have to traverse the whole list to find the value
