# FizzBuzzTree
Fizz Buzz challenge using trees

## Challenge
Given a tree root, traverse the tree and see if the node values are divisible by 15, 5, and 3. If they are divisible by 15, write out "FizzBuzz". Tf they are divisible by 5, write out "Buzz". If they are divisible by 3, write out "Fizz". Everything else, print out the value.

## Approach & Efficiency

Time: O(n)
Since you have to iterate through every node, it is O(n).
Space: O(1)
We are not making new nodes, we are just traversing through what is already given. Space is O(1).
