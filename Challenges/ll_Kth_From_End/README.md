# Linked List Kth From the end
A method that returns the kth item from the end of the linked list
## Challenge
Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the node’s value that is k from the end of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O time: O(N)
Since we will iterate through the slinked list and that depends on the amount of nodes in the list, it will be O(n);
Big O space: O(1)
We will just search the linked list so we don't create any new items that will take up space
