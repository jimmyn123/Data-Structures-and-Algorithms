# Breadth First Traversal
A breadth first traversal of a binary tree

## Challenge
Given a binary tree, do a breadth first traversal of the tree and write it out to console

## Approach & Efficiency

Big O time: O(n)
You have to iterate through every element in the binary tree. That is n nodes, therefore time is O(n)
Big O space: O(1)
We aren't creating any new objects. We are using the same nodes we had before therefore space is O(1).
