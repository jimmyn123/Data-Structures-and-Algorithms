# Fibonacci
Find the nth number of the fibonnaci sequence
## Challenge
Given a number n, calculate the nth number of the fibonacci sequence.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O time: O(n)
Since we will iterate through to the nth number and will not stop until the nth number, it is O(n) time.
Big O space: O(1)
The space is one since we do not need to create anything but 3 variables. As such, it is O(1) space.
