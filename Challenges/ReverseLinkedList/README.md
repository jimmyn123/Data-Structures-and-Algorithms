# Reverse Linked List
## Challenge
Given a linked list, reverse the inputs of the list (first element becomes last, last becomes first, etc)

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O time: O(n)
Since we will traverse through the whole linked list, it is O(n) time.
Big O space: O(1)
The space is one since we do not need to create anything but variables. As such, it is O(1) space.
