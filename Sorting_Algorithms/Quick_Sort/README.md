# Quick Sort
A quick sort algorithm

# What is it
This is a sorting algorithm that sorts according to a pivot. It will sort everything that is less or greater than it.

# Implementation
This was implemented using an array, two helper functions and a left and right index.

# Big O
Time: O(nlogn)
This is n log n because you essentially iterate and have log n pivots, but go through it for every n.
Space: O(1)
We are not creating a new array, we are modifying elements in place.
