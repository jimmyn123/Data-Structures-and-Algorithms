# Quick Sort
A merge sort algorithm

# What is it
This is a sorting algorithm that continuously splits an array into two halves then reconstructs it by ordering the two halves.

# Implementation
This was implemented using an array, two helper functions and a left and right array as well as a big array.

# Big O
Time: O(nlogn)
This is n log n because you essentially iterate and have log n pivots, but go through it for every n.
Space: O(1)
We are not creating a new array, we are modifying elements in place.
