# Sorting algorithms
Contained here is an accumulation of different sorting algorithm implementations.

# What is it
This is a sorting algorithm that will take a value at n and compare it to every value before it. It does it for the whole array list.

# Implementation
This was implemented using an array, a for loop and a while loop on the inside.

# Big O
Time: O(n^2)
This is n squared because you essentially iterateo through each element twice.
Space: O(1)
We are not creating a new array, we are modifying elements in place.
